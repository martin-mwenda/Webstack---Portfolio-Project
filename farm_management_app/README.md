# Farm Management API

This project provides a backend API for a farm management application. It utilizes Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB to manage data related to farm operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* MongoDB instance running locally or on a remote server.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [invalid URL removed]
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd farm-management-app
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following 1  environment variables: Â  
 1. 
github.com
github.com

MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection URI.
PORT (Optional): The port on which the server will listen (defaults to 5000).
Example .env file:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/farm-management
PORT=5000
Running the Application
Start your MongoDB instance.

Run the server:

Bash

npm start
This will start the server on the specified port (default: 5000).

Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure:

server.js: Entry point for the application.
.env: Environment variables.
package.json: Node.js dependencies and scripts.
routes/: API route handlers (e.g., expenseRoutes.js).
models/: Mongoose data models (e.g., Expense.js).
config/: Configuration files (future additions).
controllers/: Business logic (future additions).
middlewares/: Middleware functions (future additions).
utils/: Utility functions (future additions).
README.md: Documentation.
API Endpoints (Example)
Expenses:

GET /api/expenses: Get a list of all expenses.
POST /api/expenses: Create a new expense.
Note: These are just example endpoints. You'll need to implement additional API endpoints based on your specific farm management requirements.

Documentation
Detailed API documentation will be added in the future. For now, you can refer to the code comments within the route handlers (routes/) for insights into the available endpoints and their functionalities.
